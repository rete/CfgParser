<b>CfgParser</b>
is a c++ library for ini file format parsing and writing. It aims to be compatible with python 
ConfigParser module and follow the same parsing algorithm. For more information about 
the python module, see the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html">ConfigParser</a> webpage.


<h2>Overview</h2>

The CfgParser library parses *.cfg file with a specific syntax. Those are organized 
in sections that contains option/value pairs. The syntax is as follow:

<pre>
[sectionName]

# this is a comment
anOption : aValue
anInteger : 42

# note the space on the second value line
aLongOption = this is a long 
   line value
aSpecialOption : %(anInteger)s is the answer of everything

</pre>

Note the special option at the end. By using cfgparser::CfgParser class, this kind of value can
be interpolated with an other option in the same section or in the default one. Additional
interpolation can be done on initialization in the code. This mean that the option 'aSpecialOption'
will be resolved as "42 is the answer of everything". This is a very useful mechanism.

Lines that begin with a # or a ; are comment lines, but the first encountered character must 
be a # or a ;.

A default section can be stored in a cfg file. It is created by passing an OptionValueMap object in 
the constructor.

<h2>Installation</h2>

The installation of CfgParser is described in the <a href="../../INSTALL">INSTALL</a>.


<h2>Using CfgParser</h2>
After having installed CfgParser you have to write your own main file  
that read a given file. Examples are provided in the source/example directory.


<h2>CfgParser utilities</h2>

This package also provide utilities to get directly a value from a file, using interpolation or not.
The use is very simple. To get a raw value without any interpolation, just do:

<pre>  rawcfgparser_getvalue cfgFile.cfg aSection anOption </pre>

This will display directly the asked value. In the same manner, to get a value but with an interpolation,
do:

<pre>  cfgparser_getvalue cfgFile.cfg aSection anOption </pre>
