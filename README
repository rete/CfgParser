PURPOSE :
=========

CfgParser package is a c++ library for configuration file parsing using ini format.
This package aims to be compatible with the python ConfigParser set of classes. 
It is possible to write a file from python and read it again with this library.

For python equivalent code see the official web page of documentation:
    http://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html
 
A section is read with a set of option/value pairs like :

[section]

option : 42
option1 = a long line that
  finishes on an other line
option2 = %(option)s is the answer of everything

where option2 will resolve in "42 is the answer of everything" if the CfgParser class is used

See doc/html/index.html after building the documentation with doxygen
